We decided to follow the 306 Test Init pretty closely in order
to make sure that we wrote enough good tests. We changed a number
of parts of the code to match our board and I will document 
those below:

ROWS/COLS - We set these values to match our 20x20 board
Setup - We changed the names of the data files to match ours
TestRoomLabels - we changed the room names and room symbols to match our data
TestDimensions - kept the same
FourDoorDirections - set the specific locations of our doors
testNumberOfDoorways - set our num of doors
testRooms - set our room types as well as their labels
	Ex. walkway becomes hallway and closet becomes storage
